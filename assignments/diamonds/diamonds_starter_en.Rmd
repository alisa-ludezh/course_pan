# Introduction

![Diamonds](diamonds.jpg)

Diamond's price is affected by multiple factors. The most important factors are considered 'the 4 C's': **carate** (weight), **color**,  **clarity** and **cut**. In this assignment you are required to explore how these are related to the diamond's price and to build a regression model for predicting the price. 

## The dataset

The data for building the model are available in the `diamonds_train.txt` file.

**Variables:**

- **carat** - diamond's weight in carat (1 carat = 0.2 g)

- **colour** - diamond's color shade (D - I). The finest diamonds have no visible shade and are completely transparent (D). The least valuable diamonds have a yellowish shade (I)

- **clarity** - most diamonds have small defects visible on the surface or inside the stone. The clarity rating tells how noticeable these defects are. The best stones have IF (Internally Flawless) rating. These have no visible inclusions, but may have small scratches on the surface noticeable only to experts. The VVS1 and VVS2 (Very Very Slightly Included) diamonds have smallest, barely noticeable inclusions. The VS1 and VS2 diamonds have some small inclusions, clearly noticeable under 10x magnification. 

- **certification**  - most diamonds are certified by an independent agency before sale. This certification ensures buyer that the specs provided by the seller are true. There are 3 international agencies issuing these certificates - GIA, IGI and HRD 

- **price** - diamond price, in Singapore Dollars (prices are quite outdated, they originate from around ~2000). This is the target variable you need to predict.


All diamonds have specific cut to emphasize the natural beauty of each stone and to mask the defects. The optimal cut shouldn't be too tall or too flat, since this will impair the play of light. There are several cut types, however this file contains only the diamonds of the classical, round cut.

## Assignment

You are required to explore the data and to create a predictive model for pricing the diamonds. 
Next, based on your model, you'll need to predict prices for all the diamonds in the `diamonds_test.txt` file.

## Hand-in

You'll submit two files: 

  - **HTML report**, created by knitting the R Markdown file. The report should describe the data analysis steps, building and testing the models. All output should be accompanied by some interpretation/conclusion. You'll probably try lots of options during your exploration, so, when finished, remove everything that appeared to be not helpful. A good rule of thumb would be: 'If you can't conclude anything based on the output, you don't need it'.
  
  Remember to put your name(s) in the `author` section at the top of this file.
  
  
  - **Your price forecast** for diamonds in the `diamonds_test.txt` file. The forecast must be saved into a file named `prices.txt`. The file must have a single column labelled `price` containing price forecasts for diamonds in the `diamonds_test.txt` file. Keep the same order of diamonds. Use dot `.` as a decimal separator.
  
  Your forecasts will be processed using a script, so wrong format for the output file will result in inability to calculate the forecast error and disqualification of your work.
  

## The competition rules

- You can work on your own, or in a pair
- All non-disqualified submissions will get 2 points
- The winners will get 1 additional point
- There are 2 nominations for the winners - the most accurate forecast (by the MAPE metric), - the best report (the most reasonable approach).
If two submitted works will have identical accuracy, the first submitted work will be announced a winner.

- Some reasons for the disqualification: 
    - plagiarism, 
    - absence of exploratory analysis, building a 'blindfold' model,
    - incorrect methodology (e.g. your analysis shows that the model has a very bad fit, but you didn't anything to correct the issues), 
    - inability to provide the forecast in the required format (see Hand-In section).

## Solution

The recommended steps are listed below

 1. Load the training data using the `readr::read_tsv()` function. Make sure all data loaded up correctly. Check for any missing data and do cleaning, if required.
 
 2. Explore the distributions for all variables in the dataset. Are there any outliers or asymmetry in the distribution?
 
 3. Explore the relationships between the factors and the target variable. Note that categorical variables can also influence the price. Are the relationships linear? Are there any outliers?
 
 4. Build and test a few multiple regression models for diamond prices. Include interactions and/or non-linear terms, if necessary. As an example of such interaction, consider that different categories of diamonds have different weight-price relationships. [Here](https://www.diamonds.pro/diamond-prices/) you can find a paper from a diamond appraisal expert

 5. When you've got a satisfactory model, use it to create the forecast for all the diamonds in the test file. Save your predictions into the  `prices.txt` file, using the `readr::write_tsv()` function. The file should contain a single column `price` with the forecasted price. The order of records should be the same as in the test file. Use dot as a decimal separator.
