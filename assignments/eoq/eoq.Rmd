## Assignment

Recreate the plot from Wikipedia page on [Economic Order Quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_order_quantity).
Economic Order Quantity is a famous model developed for inventory management about 100 years ago by Ford Harris and later popularized by Wilson. It calculates the order quantity to minimize total inventory cost given the demand, the unit inventory holding cost and the ordering cost. Use the parameters (demand, costs, etc.) provided on that page.
